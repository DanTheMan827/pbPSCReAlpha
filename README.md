# pbPSCReAlpha

A little software to edit the order of directories on an USB key used with bleemsync.

To use it, select your "Games" directory with the text field or the Browse button.

Check the checkbox if you don't want to change the 20 first (in case you copied the psc content on the usb key and you don't want to edit anything for the 20 first directories).

Click on "Do it".

During the process, the directories are renamed with (number+1000), then renamed from 1 (or 21 if checkbox) to your max.


WARNING !!! To be ok until the end, don't open any files from the usb key before or during the process.
Eject the usb key before reconnecting it (without opening anything) and launch the software.

WARNING 2 !!!!! Don't forget, you have to relaunch bleemsync after using this.
